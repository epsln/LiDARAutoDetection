Throughout this document, we have seen a variety of solutions to the problem's inherent with automated detection in remote sensing imagery. Most of the networks presented here uses some kind of feature fusion module. Qian et al, seen in section \ref{qianAl} also uses a novel Generalized Intersection Over Union formula to obtain a better positioning of the bounding boxes. 

A model designed for automated detection in LiDAR imagery would take inspiration from such architectures. A feature fusion module, along with a finer grid and less downsampling would be used to lessen the information loss throughout the model, and help detect small and cluttered object. The GIoU loss could be used to improve the bounding box position.
