The University of Leiden holds the fifth place in the SustainaBul, a ranking of the most sustainable higher educations institutions. This ranking is done by the national student network in the Netherlands, the \textit{Studenten Voor Morgen}. Industrial Ecology and biodiversity, among other sustainable themes are an important part of the University research and teachings. 

Leiden University also holds the 7th place in UI Green Metric, a sustainability ranking created by the University of Indonesia. This rankings looks into a given University take on the challenges of energy, recycling, transportation, water or climate change. The University of Leiden quickly rose among this ranking, coming from the 49th place only two years ago. This rise in ranking comes from the multiple actions undertaken by the University to create a more sustainable and carbon neutral environment. For example, many extra solar panels were installed on the University buildings, and the waste generated is now recycled in the entire University. Working with other universities through their national network has also helped Leiden to gather and share much more information to the organisers of the UI Green Metric. Effort is still ongoing to enhance the sustainability score by investing more funds in the areas of Education, Research and into greener infrastructure. The National goal is to make all of Netherlands Universities enter the ranking top 50.
